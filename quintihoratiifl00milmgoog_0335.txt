My object has been to 'give the youthful reader as vlvid a picture of the
main facts of Grecian history, and of the leading characteristics of the
,political institutions, literature, and art ol the people‚ as oould be comprised
within the limits ps a volume of moderate siae. With this view 1 have
omitted entirely, or dismissed in a few paragraphs, many circumstances
recorded in similar works, and have thus gained space for narrating at
length the more important events, and for bringing out prominently the
characters and lives os the great men of the nation. It is only in this way i
that a school history can be made instructive and interesting, since a brief
and tedious enumeration of every event, whether great or small, important ,
or unimportant, conluses the reader and leaves no permanent impression
upon his memory. Considerable space has been given to the history of
literature and art, since they form the most durable evidentes of a nation’s ’
growth in civilization and insocial progress. Aknowledge of these subjects 3
is of great importanee to a pupil at the commencement of his classical
studies. -Author's Preface. “
