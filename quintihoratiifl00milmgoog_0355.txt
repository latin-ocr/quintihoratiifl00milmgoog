T lte 'Student’c Latin Gramman by WM. SMITH, ἶ
LLD. δι Tunorunus D. HALL, MA. Newedition. Post 8v0, 6s.

“This pammac is intended and well calculated to occupy an intennediate position
between the large treatises os Zumpt and Madvig, and the numerous elementary school
grammars prevalent amongst us. There are very few students who will require more
information than is here supplied: aud yet, by a skilsul arrangement of the materials and
typography, the volume is reduced to a very convenient size and form for practical use.
The editor's good sense is visible throughout. When he cannot consult the requirements
os strictly scientific method, or introduce modern improvements of nomenclature without
doing such'violence to established usage as to cause sen'ous practical inconvenience, he
reirains. At the same time he is not so wedded to existing customs as to retain anything ¹
positively erroneous, which'the student must afterwards unlearn. Some usesul remarks
are added on the characteristic styles ot' the chief prose writers, and therappendix on the
alphabet is full of suggestive information.”-Attenaeum.
