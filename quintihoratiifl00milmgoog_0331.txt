This Work is designed to supply a long-acknowledged want in
our School Literature-a HISTORY os ENGLAND in a volume of

moderate size, sor the UPPER nuo Mmoru Foruus. While Huuu's
language has been retained, as far as was practicable‚ luis errore
have been corrected, and his deficiencies supplied. The Roman and
Saxon periods have been almost entirely re-written. In the re-
maining portion of the work very many important corrections and
additions have been made from recent Writers.

“The want which this work is intended to supply has long been evident, aud no more
judicious effort could have been made sor the purpose, than to condense Hume's informa-
tion without damaging his cleamess, or the matchless purity os his style. ’'-Jolm Butt

“This work is certainly well done. The additional matter in the form of Notes and
Illustrations is, in a literary sense, the most remarkable feature. Many important sub-
jects‚ constitutionak legal, or sociat, are thus treated; and, a very usesul plan, the whole
authorities ot¹ the period are mentioned at its closed-aspectare.
