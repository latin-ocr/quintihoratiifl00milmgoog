This work has been written (byan English scholar long resident in
France, and intimately acquainted with its literature and history. It is
intended, like the preceding works in the same serieS, to supply a long
acknowledged want in our literature, namely, a H1STORY 01². F RANcE, in-
corporating the researches of recent historiens, and suitable for the higher
forms in Schools and for Students at the Universities. 1t is unnecessary to

point out the importance of a knowledge of French history to every one l

who aspires to a liberal education; but it may not be amiss to remind the

l
l

reader that the true meaning and effect of the drama of the Revolution, of ,

which we have not yet seen the catastrophe, can be understood only by a
iar deeper study of the previous condition and history of F rauce thau most
of our countrymen are disposed to undertake. The author's desire has been
to avoid the capital error of writing the history of France from an English
point of view, a course which cannot fail to convey an unjust conception of
the institutions, government, habits, and character of the people. What is
needed is an impartial, genial, and even sympathetic account of F rench his·
tory.-Edz't0r's Prefircc.

“This History of F rance is the digested work of a thorough French scholar, who,
having entered into the spirit of the nation and its history, knows how to generalize and

knit into one pertinent whole the sequence of events. It is the best work os its kind ac-
cessible to readers of all classes-Examina.

“ This volume is calculated to do much good; by a candid and impartial statement of
facts, it may dispel prejudices, and enable the student hereaster, in the ripeness of'scholar-
skip, diligently to enlarge and scientifically to methodize the information it affords. The

Ι author has collected his authorities with able research, and scrutinized them with unbiassed

judgment.”-Moming Post.

“This work is entitled to the praise os meeting an acknowledged want; a history os
France, presented in a comprehensive and perspicuous view. It has, also, the coherency,
liveliness, and just comprehension of the facts and their relations, which mark a genuine
authorship, in distinction from the work of a mere compiler.'’-Nonconfhmnist.

“We doubt whether there was any greater literary want than a really good English

History of France. That want is now supplied by the work besore us. The matter iswell
selected, and well condensed; the style is clear and sorcible.''-Gardeners' Chronicle.

“The style is perspicuous and dignified‚ though not wanting in vivacity. It is not a
history of France written from an English view-point, and designed to flatter the pride of
Englishmen It is quite catholic in spirit, and thoroughly sympathetic in tone.''-Tht
Mmeum.
