This single volume contains subjects usually distributed over two or more
separate works; and there can be little doubt that a pupil who has mastered
it will have been well grounded in Latin verse, and thus be able to enter
upon the study of Virgil and Ovid with greater advantage, than if he had
attempted to read those authors without a similar preparatory training.
