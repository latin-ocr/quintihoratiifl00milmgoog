“There is no other work at present existing which so ably supplies a History of Rome ἶ
suited to the wants 01' the general readers os the present day. To the youthsul student,
to the man who cannot read many volumes, we should commend it as the one history
which will convey the latest views and most extensive information. The style is simple,
clear, and explanatory.’'-Blackwood.

“Dr. Liddell has given a lucid, well-marked, and comprehensive view of the progress
and revolutions of the Roman State and people. The course of the history is distinctly
mapped out by broad and natural divisions ; and the order in which it is arranged and
presented is the work of a strong and clear mind. There is great skill as well as diligence
shown in the amount os facts which are collected and compressed into the narrative; and
the story is told, not merely with full intelligence, but with an earnestness and strength os
feeling which cannot be mistaken.''-Guardian.

‘⁴ Dr. Liddell’s History is adapted to the purpose of readers who desire a knowledge of
the ‘altered aspect which Roman history has assumed! By means οἱ a skilsully arranged
structure, not only the different periods os the history, but their various subdividens, are
presented as distinct parts, yet each having a relation to a larger whole. The general
treatment is also judicious. The alleged events, sor instance, of the early period, are
rapidly touched, while the social, political, and constitutional arrangements are sully
expounded.’'—Spectator.

“This excellent History os Rome will supersede every other work on tlu subject. ”-
John Bull.
