“All that refers to the accidence and ¹etymology is os the highest excellence, and there
s no Greek Grarnmar in existence which in so small a compass contains so much valuable

standard Greek Grammar, a position which it has already acquired in most os the schools
ol continental Europe.”-Tlre M ustum.
