This Manual presents, in a systematic form, and in a moderate
compass‚ the most important results embodied in the “ Dictionary
of Greek and Roman Geography.’' The original work containsa
great mass os information derived from the researches of modern
travellers and scholars, which have not yet been made available
lor the purposes of instruction in our colleges and schools.

Besides adapting the larger work, sor a different class of readers,
many valuable additions have been made, of which the most im·
portant are :—

1. A history ol Geography in Antiquity, containing an account
os the views of the Hebrews, as well as ol the Greeks and Romans,
illustrated by maps of the world as known to the poets, historians,
and geographers

2. A full account of Scriptural Geography.

3. Numerous quotations from the Greek and Roman poete, which
either illustrate, or are illustrated by, the statements in the text

Great pains have been taken to make the book as interesting as
the nature of the subject would allow. The tedium naturally pro
duced by an enumeration ol political boundaries and topographical
notices is relieved by historical and ethnographical discussions,
while the numerous mapS, pians, and other illustrations give lile
and reality to the descriptions. The Retreat ol thejTen Thousand
Greeks, the Expedition of Alexander the Great‚ and similar subjects‚
are discussed and explained. lt has been an especial object to
supply information on all points required by the upper classes in tlte
problic schools, ond by students in the unz'oersities.

“A valuabie addition to our geographical worka 'It contains the newest and most
ι reliable information derived from the researches of modern travellers. No better text·

book can be placed in the hands of scholars.”-Jouml osEducation¹
