Mn. Munnnv’s
HISTORICAL CLASS BOOKS.

—›04·<--

“The series of Student's Manuals, Ancient and Modern, issued by Mr.
Murray, and most of them edited by Dr. William Smith‚ possess several
distinctive features which render them singularly valuable as Educational

, Works. They incorporate, with judicious comments, the researches of the

¹ most recent historical investigators, not only into the more modern, but into
3 the most remote periods of the history of the countries to which they refer.
ᾗ The latest lights which comparative philology has cast upon the migrations

ς and interminglings of raees, are reflected in the histories of England and

France. We know no better or more trustworthy summary, even for the
general reader‚ of the early history of Britain and Gaul, than is contained in
these volumes respectively.

“While each volume is thus, sor ordinary purposes, a complete history
of the country to which it refers, it also contains a guide to such further and
more detailed information as the advanced student may desire on particular

³ events or periods. At the end of each book, sometimes of each chapter,
there are given copious lists of standard works which constitute the ‘Antho-
rities’ for a particular period or reign. This most useful feature seems to
us to complete the great value of the works, giving to them the character of
historical cyclopaedias‚ as well as of impartial histories.''-Tlve Museum.

“Before the publication of these Student’s Manuals there had been
established, by the claims of middle-class and competitive examiners on

young men’s brains, a large annual demand for text-books that should ⁴

rise above the level of mere schoolboy’s epitomae, and give to those
who would master them some shadow of a scholarly knowledge of their
subjeets. Such books were very hard to find. Mr. Murray now brings
out his seven-and-sixpenny manuals. They are most fit for use in the
higher classes of good schools, where they may be deliberately studied
through with the help of a teacher competent to expand their range
of argument, to diversisy their views by the strength of his own reading
and reflection, and to elicit thought from the boys themselves upon events
and the political changes to which they have led. Even the mature

τ scholar may be glad to have on his shelves these elegant manuals, from

which he can at a glance refresh his memory as to a name or date, and ho
will not use them for reference alone. He will assuredly be tempted to
read them sor the cleamess of statement and the just proportion with which
there is traced in each of them the story of a nation.”-Examiner.
