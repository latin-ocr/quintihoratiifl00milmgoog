The main object ol this work is to enable a Beginner'to fix the
Declensions and Conjugations thoroughly in his memory, to leam
their usage by construeting simple sentences as soon as he com-
mences the study os the language, and to accumulate gradually a
stock of usesul words. It presents in one book all that the pupil
will require sor some time in his study os the language.

Τ liis Wnrk‚ which contains o Grammar, Dilectus, Exercita-
book‚ and Vocabnlnries‚ lias been prnnnunced by the “grinders 0 l
small boys '’ wizo have used it, to be by far ilie ensz‘est and best book
for beginners in Latin.

PRINCIPIA LATINA, PART II.
A nnAmNG-Boon.

Containing Fables,¹ Antoninis, Myilznlogy‚ Gangraplzy, Roman
A ntiqnities, ond History.

With Notes and a Dictionary, 12m0, 3s. od.

This work is intended to surnish a Latin Reading-book suitable
or beginners, sufficient in quantity while interesting and instructive
n matter, and thus prepare the way sor Caesar or any other classieal
author. It is believed that it will not only prove interesting, but
serve as an introduction to Ancient Mythology, Geography, Roman
History‚ and Antiquities.

It should be used in conjunction witi the First Part of the
“Principia Latina.” As soon as the pupil has learnt thoroughly
the Declensions and Conjugations‚ and can translate the simplest
sentences² it is important to diversify the somewhat dry and tedious

· work os the Delectus and Exercise-book, by giving him connected
passages containing interesting and instructive matter.
