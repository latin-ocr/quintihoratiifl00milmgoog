“ Dr. Wm. Smith’s Dictionaries form an important clement in our modern English
scholarship. Probably no modern books have done so much to extend a knowledge
of the reseasohes and conclusions of the learned men of our time in the field of

antiquity. If the Dictionaries to come are as well executed as their predecessors,
the longer Dr. Smith continues to publish the better ordinary scholars will be
pleased''-Guardr'an.

the classica] examinem to the University of london-appointed, 1 will say it to his honour,
after fair and strict comparison with some scholars of the highest eminence in our nationa
Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. Itis an honour to this College to have presented

manuals of classieal antiquity and classica] history and biography, done as much as any
man living to promote the accurate knowledge of the Greek and Roman world among the
studente of this age 1 trust that among those names which we have heard mentioned

than one who will aspire to emulate Dr. Wm Smith’s diligent and honourable course,

instruction which he has received within these walls-Mn Grote'r Adduo at the London
