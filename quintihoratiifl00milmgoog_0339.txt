“ Gibbon's ‘Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire’ forms the import-
ant link between Ancient and Modern history. Its title conveys an l

inadequate idea of its contents. It contains nearly a complete history of
the world for a period of more than twelve centuries, from the time of the
Antonines to the capture of Constantinople by the Turks in 1453. Since
the history of all ancient nations ends in that of Rome, and the history of
modern states of Europe springs out of the Roman Empire, the youthfirl
historical student, after making himself acquainted with the leading facts in
the histories of Greece, Rome, and England, cannot employ his time more
profitably than'in mastering the history of the vast period eomprehended
in Gibbon’s work. Itis mainly for the benefit of such students that the
present Abridgment has been prepared3 but it is believed that it will also
prove acceptable to the general reader, whose time or circumstances prevent
him from studying so large a work as Gibbon's‚ but who wishes to make
himself acquainted with some of the most memorable events imthe history
of καθ’-[Μαι.

“ Dr. Smith has already earned the thanks of this generation of scholars by a series os
publications. He has now edited Gibbon in a single compaet volume, with one hundred
well-choses wood engravings of buildings, coins, and other antiquities. Besidesabririgureut¹
the chief alterations are the omission os offensive anti-christian sneers, and the incor-
poration of important notes ln the body of the text. Dr. Smith has preserved the main
features of the great historian's work ’'-Guardian.

‘¹ ‘ Gibbon’s Decllu md talk* will live long as one of the noblest works in the English
language; but it is too voluminous for the young student. Dr. Smith has drawn up an
admirable abridgmm of it, using as far as possible the language of the original, and
adopting the plan of omitting or treating briefly circumstances of inferior importunes, so
that the grand events which have influenced the history os the world may be narrated at
lengtw-cambroige Chronr'cle.

“The hest popular edition of Gibbon extant. It is pervaded byall the warmrh, life,
md power of the celebrated original; and is Just some such volume as Gibbon himself
would bave issued, had he deemed it proper to send forth a digest of his own immortal ³
personnance.’'-Clmstian Witmss. ’ ’
