“1 have been sor some time in the habit of using the Dictionaries oi Antiquity and
Ancient Biogmphy, as wellas the Dictionary οἰ Ancient Geography, and 1 have no hesi·
ration in saying, from my knowledge os them, that they are iar superior to any other pub·

lications os the same sort in our language. They are works which every student os ’

ancient literature ought to consult habitually, and which are-indispensable to every person
engaged in original researches into any department οἰ antiquity.”-Sir G. C. Lewth

“l willingly bear testimony to the great value oi your Dictionaries oi Classical Anti-
quities, os Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, and ot' Greek and Roman
Geography. I have had frequent occasion to consult these works, and have derived from
them great assistance and instruction. In no other publications known to me is so much
trustworthy information got together and rendered easily accessible for elucidating matters
os (act connected with the history οἰ Greece and Rome.”-George Grote. ¹

work os so much utility to the study οῖ’ ancient history, and os such general importance to
classical edueation and the progressos knowledge, that its extensive circulation wherever
the English langttage isspoken or read may confideutly be anticipated”-Col. Leuke. ·

“I have much pleasure in expressing the high estimate which I have formed oi Dr.
william Smith’s many vuluable works, which have been ior some years past in general
